# Snake_Game
Snake Game is a classic arcade game that involves controlling a snake that moves around a game board, eating food and growing in size while avoiding obstacles and the edges of the board. Turtle Graphics is a module in Python that provides a way to create graphics and draw shapes using a turtle that can be controlled through code. Building the Snake Game with Turtle Graphics using Python involves combining these two concepts to create a fully functional game that can be played on a Python console.
To start building the Snake Game with Turtle Graphics, the first step is to import the turtle module and initialize the screen. Next, you will need to create a turtle object to represent the snake, set its position on the screen, and define its initial direction. After that, you can define the movement of the snake by specifying the actions that will be taken when the user presses certain keys.
To create the food that the snake will eat, you can use the turtle module to draw a circle on the screen. Then, you will need to write code to check if the snake has collided with the food and update its size accordingly.
Finally, you will need to keep track of the score and display it on the screen. You can do this by creating a variable to store the score and updating it every time the snake eats a piece of food. You can then display the score using the turtle module.
Overall, building the Snake Game with Turtle Graphics using Python is a fun and challenging project that combines elements of game development and programming. With a little bit of creativity and some basic Python skills, you can create a fully functional game that you can play and share with others.
